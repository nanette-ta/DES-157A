    <h2>Please open the console to see the functionality of the code.</h2>

        /* This program will use console.log() to print all numbers from 1 to 100. The two exceptions being: numbers divisible by 3 will print "Fizz" instead, and numbers divisibily by 5 (and not 3) will print "Buzz" instead. */

        // Sequence: This program follows the sequence of printing "Fizz" before "Buzz" and then printing the number under certain selections. This means if there is a number that is divisible by both 3 and 5 like 15, due to printing "Fizz" coming first before printing "Buzz", the console will print "Fizz" first. Ex. 15 will print "Fizz".
        // Loop: for loop that iterates from numbers 1 to 100 by increasing the starting number by 1 till 100.
        for (var i=0; i<101; i++){
            // Selection: The console will log "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3.
            if (i % 3 === 0) {
                console.log("Fizz");
            }
            // Selection: The console will log "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5 and not by 3.
            else if (i % 5 === 0 && i % 3 !== 0){
                console.log("Buzz");
            }
            // Selection: The console will log the number if the number does not fall under either if or elif statement.
            else {
                console.log(i);
            }
