            <h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialogue Windows</h2>
            <date>January 30, 2025</date>
            <p>The article, “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialogue Windows,” by Naema Baskanderi, discusses best tips on how to effectively implement modals within a design. Modals are elements that appear on top of the parent page. Usually, when they appear, they introduce new information that can be relevant for the user. Modals are popular because they allow designers to show more information on a page without having to disrupt the page’s original design and structure. However, using them may also introduce pain points for users. As a result, there are many tips to practice to incorporate them seamlessly and efficiently.</p>

            <p>For example, users should be given the option to leave the modal. Baskanderi discusses the importance of allowing the user autonomy over whether or not they want to engage with the modal. Furthermore, she emphasizes the importance of clear descriptive titles and call to action buttons. Modals with these features are easier to navigate and understand. One tip in the article that stood out to me was that modals should be placed on the upper part of the screen for responsiveness in mobile views. In hindsight, I think that the article was very informative and helpful.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <date>January 25, 2025</date>
            <p>In the article, “<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f
                ">Best practices for form design</a>,” by Salim Ansari, I learned about twenty best tips for creating user-centered form designs. I was intrigued to learn more about minimizing the input fields of forms. In my classes, I learned about cognitive overload and how it can lower user satisfaction and a product’s overall productivity. I think that this tip also ties in well with the one column layout suggestion.</p>

            <p>In the past, I have used <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/forms/">Google Forms</a> for conducting and answering user surveys for project case studies. I like that Google Forms is intuitive and easy to use for first-time users. After reading the article, I realized that many of the best tips are practiced by Google Forms – such as a one column layout. In my opinion, Google Form’s one column layout allows users to fill out the form more efficiently. Furthermore, users can answer the questions in a chronological order. I also noticed that Google Forms has many labels that increase readability and informational hierarchy. Overall, I think that the article was very insightful and interesting. It gave me more perspective on forms and their designs.</p>
