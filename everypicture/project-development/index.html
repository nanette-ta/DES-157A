            <h2>My Design Comp</h2>
            <p>For my every picture project, I would like to implement a mouse hover effect on each item. My theme/topic is loot that I would drop in a video game. These loot items are items that are unique and special to me. I want the user to be able to hover over each item with their mouse. From there, I want the screen to zoom in on the item. I also want to implement a pop-up overlay/modal on each item. In this overlay/modal, I would explain the itemâ€™s significance and importance. For my overall design style, I would like to add game-like typography to mimic older RPG games. </p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./images/allLoot.png" alt="All Loot" width="520" height="400">
                <img src="./images/modal.png" alt="Modal Pop-up" width="520" height="300">
